Here is my final project for my AP Physics C course.
This was my first foray into computational simuation so a *little* bit of AI was used here as guidance
Overall, though, the majority of the code is my own, and the only thing I used from the AI was to get a baseline for the vectoral calculations, as well as the dynamic DOM loading b/c I had no idea how to do that ):
